Though the rapper hasn’t made an official statement regarding a name change, it seems she is now known as Latto and is following through with a decision years in the making. Throughout her career, the rapper faced mounting backlash and accusations of promoting colorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since as early as 2016, the female emcee — who identifies as biracial — has garnered severe criticism from people on social media who deemed her former moniker as insensitive to people of mixed race. During an appearance on the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Facts</a>” podcast in February, Latto, whose real name is Alyssa Michelle Stephens, claimed she was not aware of the term’s racist roots.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1267687183-600x434.jpg><p>She also felt as though her intentions behind her stage name were misinterpreted, stating, “They take ‘Mulatto’ as me thinking that’s like a personality trait. I wake up and be like, ‘I’m mixed. Before I even brush my teeth, I be like, ‘B-tch, I’m mixed.’ And they take [it] as that, and that’s not what that means.’”</p><p>However, despite revealing that she wasn’t affected by the critiques she received, Latto noted that she’d be “careless” not to consider sound advice. Simultaneously, the “B-tch from Da Souf” rapper seemingly already had her backup name ready, telling blog site Female Rap Room that there would be a name change but it wouldn’t come without a proper rollout. “It’s something that needs to be a bigger production,” she explained. “I need to be able to speak on it, and people hear me out. I wanted to do it deeper than a tweet like, ‘Oh. I’m changing my name,’ end of story. I feel like that’s not sensitive enough to the subject matter.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mulatto now appears on streaming platforms and iTunes under the name “Latto” 🎰 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kOMfrYZj5M</a></p>— Female Rap Room (@FemaleRapRoom) <a href=#>May 18, 2021</a></figure><p>On Instagram, where she also teased a new single titled “Latto,” her handle now reads <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@latto777</a>. Folks on social media have already started weighing in on the news. A large group of people didn’t appear to have an issue with the rapper’s name initally, including one Twitter user who wrote, “I just think if we see no problem with saying n-gga then mulatto should be fine but that’s just my opinion lol. However I think it can limit her in some situations.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just think if we see no problem with saying nigga then mulatto should be fine but that’s just my opinion lol.
