What is Khloe’s deal?”</p><img decoding=async alt="Khloe is skinnier than EVER in bikini & 'threatens' Tristan with scathing quote" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NA-Khloe-Skinny-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="How Khloe K is 'putting True in danger' with innocent mistake, expert reveals" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/la-parenting-expert-on-khloe-kardashian-and-true-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In the post’s comment thread, Kardashian fans had a lot to say about Khloe’s conception that the NBA star is presently a good dad now or that he will be when their second baby arrives.</p><p>One person wrote: “I have a hard time believing this.”</p><p>A second Redditor commented: “You can’t be a good dad if you’re only there for one of your kids.”</p><p>Another commenter wrote: “This is such a bulls**t narrative. He’s not a good dad. He hasn’t even seen one of his kids. He MIGHT possibly be a decent dad to True when you use his other [children’s] dynamics as a comparison.”</p><p>Fans are referring to the report that Tristan hasn’t, nor does he have immediate plans to, meet his son, Theo, of six months.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Imagine being an adult woman who is totally fine with a deadbeat dad showing up for your kids while shunning the rest of the children he’s fathered in the meantime.”</p><p>A second contributor added: “This idea that he can selectively be a good dad to one of his kids, but a terrible one to others is complete bulls**t.”</p><p>Another person reasoned: “If he does [step up] great. But that’s even more of a f**king f**ked up thing given he doesn’t see his other child. What a disgrace. Poor Theo.”</p><h2>GOOD DAD?</h2><p>One Redditor questioned: “I’d like Khloe to define what being a good dad is.”</p><p>Others responded, with one fan writing: “[Someone who] shows up for the occasional birthday party or photoshoot and doesn’t leak or expose family secrets.”</p><p>Another person replied: “[It’s] definitely not treating the mother of his children with respect.”</p><p>A third commenter simply wrote: “Khlow standards.”</p><p>“This is why he goes out of this way to show off how much he doesn’t give a s**t, partying and messing around with random chicks”, commented another.</p><p>A, very blunt, fan added: “He’s f**king all around Mykonos with literally zero discretion. He has absolutely nothing to worry about with his doormat back home.”</p><p>One person explained what a good father is, commenting: “He sees his daughter sporadically. He is not a good father. A good father cares for his children every day, is honest, responsible, and consistently available.”</p><p>An angry Redditor threw shade toward Khloe for feeling the way she does, writing: “It’s the fact that she said ‘he’s a wonderful dad to True’ she specified which child. [It] makes me sick.”</p><p>Finally, a fan commented: “He’s not a good dad and she looks dumb saying it.”</p><h2>BREAKING THE SILENCE</h2><p>Earlier this week, Khloe broke her silence for the first time since the announcement of her second child with ex Tristan Thompson.</p><p>The Chicago Bull’s power forward has been&nbsp;partying it up in Greece&nbsp;lately and was spotted&nbsp;holding hands with a mystery woman.</p><p>The&nbsp;Hulu&nbsp;star took to&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;to post for the first time in days as she shared various photos with her only child&nbsp;True, four.</p><p>In the snaps, the 38-year-old rocks a camouflage swimsuit while waist-deep in beautiful clear water.</p><p>Khloe’s little one True has her arms wrapped around her famous mom as the duo strike up different poses.</p><p>The reality star captioned the batch of pics: “Me and my best girl making the best memories. I will forever have your back my angel girl.”</p><p>Fans were quick to react to the new post as one wrote: “Love you both so much,” while another added, “She really is very blessed to have you as her mama.”</p><p>“It’s great she is going to have a sibling…” one chimed in.</p><p>However, others were harsher and reacted: “Please let this be the last time! You deserve better for and your kids.”</p><h2>THE ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><p>The&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;alum shares True with her ex&nbsp;Tristan, but Khloe’s representative recently confirmed that the TV star is having a&nbsp;second child via a surrogate mother.</p><p>“Khloe is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing,” the rep shared.</p><p>The baby is&nbsp;expected to be a boy, as an insider shared with&nbsp;PageSix: “Khloe has always wanted a little brother for True and decided to go ahead with having the baby with the support of her family.”</p><p>While Khloe seems to be attempting to stay on a positive route, fans have noticed that the TV personality’s inner circle – including her sister&nbsp;Kourtney,&nbsp;Travis Barker, and her mom&nbsp;Kris Jenner&nbsp;– appear to have very recently stopped following Tristan on Instagram.</p><p>The famous athlete has also not helped his cause as he has continued to enjoy his getaway in Mykonos.</p><p>The 31-year-old was previously at the island’s Principote Beach Club and&nbsp;dined at the popular steakhouse&nbsp;Nusr-Et where the famous restauranteur, often referred to as&nbsp;Salt Bae, prepared a cut of steak at Tristan’s table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NA-Khloe-Skinny-comp.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/la-parenting-expert-on-khloe-kardashian-and-true-COMP.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000662218366-10.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vKoaOonV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsCtrcymnJ1lkah6pbHLrqqip56WuW6yzqtkm52cnrK3tc2gZK2qmajBorqMrZ%2BopaCovK951qKjpWWjqbKxedSpZJudXZZ6qLvOnWSdmZRiwbB506Gcoqpdl66jxYybprJn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lady-gaga-dares-to-bare-her-derriere-in-topless-poolside-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lady Gaga Dares to Bare Her Derriere in Topless Poolside Photo">&larr;
