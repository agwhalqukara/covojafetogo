After defining his passion, he was willing to get things straight, and so far, he has not had any regrets for switching his course of study while at Wits University. However, it looks like South Africa’s music industry may have lost one of its truest enablers since the Deejay was confirmed dead on Sunday, 6th of March, 2022.</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a621176922ee9843.jpg><p class=align-left>DJ Dimplez was a <a href=#>notable deejay</a> in South Africa. Since he stepped into the music entertainment industry, he walked his way to the top of his career with focus and consistency. Shortly before his first interview on Channel O, he came up with his present stage name. Additionally, he was once nominated for the <a href=#>South African Music Award </a>for Best <a href=#>Music</a> Video of the Year.

He is best known for his stage name as DJ Dimplez. What is DJ Dimplez's real name? His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birth name</a> is Tumi Mooi. Yet, there is no information on DJ Dimplez's age, parents, and siblings. Although little is known about his childhood days, he had a flair for music when he was younger.</p><p class=align-left>While schooling at <a href=#>Wits University</a>, he switched from a <a href=#>commerce degree</a> to sports psychology. He discovered that following his passion is more important than pursuing money.</p><p class=align-left>Since DJ Dimplez enjoys the hip-hop music genre, he improved his skills. In the process, he joined the <a href=#>Wits</a> DJ Society, hoping to find gigs at student parties and local clubs. From there, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he founded</a> the Pop Bottles movement. Based on DJ Dimplez's story, the idea came when he wanted to host his birthday party. Sharing his experience later, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he said</a>:</p>I was very clear about the idea. I wanted to create a different, branded hip hop experience. By then I’d been DJing for five years, so I knew the scene well. Nothing much happened on Sundays, and taking the party out onto a deck in the afternoon would be a whole new experience.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7d91f43664ea5a7c.jpg><h3>DJ Dimplez's career</h3><p class=align-left>Initially called DJ Tumi, Dimplez's career began in 2004. When he attended Johannesburg events, including Reality and 115, his consideration for Deejaying began to gather momentum. Eventually, he bought his equipment in 2003 and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">launched out</a> in 2004.</p><p class=align-left>He had a little issue with choosing the perfect stage name when he was starting. Names like Tombstone and Tumiza were part of the consideration. When he eventually settled for DJ Dimplez, he experienced a major transformation in his career. The first four years were challenging as he worked daily from coffee shops.</p><p class=align-left>As he began to win more fans, opportunities to travel began to beckon on him. Also, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played alongside </a>some <a href=#>prominent DJs</a> in the country, including DJ Oskido, DJ Fresh, DJ S’bu, DJ Kenzhero, and Milkshake.</p><h2>DJ Dimplez's songs</h2><p class=align-left>One of DJ Dimplez's albums, <i>Kubu</i>, was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released on</a> the 29th of November, 2019.

She claims that DJ Dimplez and herself <a href=#>met at</a> Cassper Nyovest's 2020 birthday celebration. Unfortunately, he was overdrunk to remember anything that had happened that night. As a result, he claims that the woman raped him.</p><p class=align-left>In her claim, she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> gave him</a> R100 to buy morning-after pills, but it was not enough to get the drugs. She tried the coke and aspirin to hinder her from getting pregnant, but it did not work out. Eventually, she got pregnant, and the DJ was not pleased to hear that.</p><p class=align-left>She shared a video of Dimplez and herself to prove her point, which she took with his iPhone. Videos of him booking hotels were also taken to help him recollect what happened. While everyone looked forward to reading DJ Dimplez's facts on the matter, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he shared</a> the following on his social media platform:</p>On the advice of my legal representatives, I wish to not address the matter any further on social media or any other public platform. Nor am I at liberty to do so, as the matter is before the relevant authorities.<h2>DJ Dimplez's cause of death</h2><p class=align-left>South Africa’s social media was thrown into a mournful state on the 6th of March, 2022, after news broke that DJ Dimplez <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had passed away</a>. Most fans became more interested in the cause of his death because he was last seen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gracing the funeral service</a> of the South African rapper Riky Rick a few days before the announcement of his passing.</p><p class=align-left>According to the family’s spokesperson, Shekeshe Mokgosi, the rapper died from a brain haemorrhage even though he was rushed to the hospital. In his words, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shekeshe said</a>:</p>Yes it is true, DJ Dimplez has passed away on Sunday afternoon; We would like to be given time to grieve as the family is still coming to terms with the news. We confirm that he succumbed to a brain haemorrhage, unfortunately, we can't share any more details as we are requesting privacy during this difficult time.<h2>DJ Dimplez's net worth</h2><p class=align-left>This iconic South African Deejay's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is estimated at $2 million. Apart from being a Deejay, he is associated with events and podcasts known as Pop bottles and Popcast, respectively.</p><p class=align-left>His songs are popular among listeners and have acquired impressive streams and downloads on various streaming platforms. These and many more are some of DJ Dimplez's revenue sources.</p><p class=align-left>With persistence, DJ Dimplez has walked his way to the top. His fans looked forward to getting better entertainment stuff from him in the future, but they have been left reeling from the disappointment of his demise. They can only hope that his previous works in the industry remain a legacy and a blueprint for the coming generation.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Larry David net worth, age, wife, height, show, house, profile</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Larry David</a> is a man who stands out as a comedian, actor, screenwriter, and producer in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=align-left>As published on <a href=#>We</a>, though he started rough, he eventually got his big break from the sitcom Seinfeld, which has, so far, contributed to how much he is worth.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfHJ8kGlqa2WUn3qltcypo56yXZa0pnnRnpilZaOku6i%2FjKuYqZ1dqLCiusOao2aapai2r7HSrGSfmZOpwG7DzquroWaYqbqt</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eat-like-a-star-celeb-diet-plans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eat Like a Star: Celeb Diet Plans">&larr;
