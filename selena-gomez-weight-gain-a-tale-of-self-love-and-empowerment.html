The 30-year-old singer and actress revealed to her fans in a video from a recent TikTok livestream that has since been uploaded on Twitter that she frequently gains weight while taking the drug and vice versa.</p><p>“It happens very regularly that I tend to hold a lot of water weight when taking it. I usually lose weight when I’m off of it,” Gomez posted on the video-sharing website. “I just wanted to say and encourage anyone out there who feels any sort of shame for exactly what they’re going through, and no one knows the real story.”</p><p>The star of Only Murders in the Building went on, “I just want everybody to know how amazing and gorgeous you are. Yes, there are days when we may feel like s——, but I would much rather be well and look after my needs. My drugs are essential, and I think that’s what makes me better.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena Gomez Weight Gain Critics with Empowering Message</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebtransformations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-TheNewsPocket-2024-01-30T113919.962-1-1024x576.png><p>Gomez continued talking about her experiences with body image after that. “Never will I be a model. Not to mention, I believe they’re fantastic. Simply put, I’m not that,” she continued. “I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your support and love for me. And if not, please leave, as I genuinely don’t think it’s appropriate to shame anyone for anything, including their bodies.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Who Says”</a> singer revealed her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lupus diagnosis</a> in 2015. She has now made several open remarks criticizing those who shame others for their bodies. She shared her opinions on trying to diet on TikTok last year, and she clapped back at anyone who said anything nasty about her appearance.</p><p>“So I will be trying to stay skinny, but I went to Jack in the Box and I got four tacos, three egg rolls, onion rings, and a spicy chicken sandwich,” she explained. “But to be honest, I don’t give a damn about my weight because people often make fun of it. “That doesn’t fit,” “You’re too big,” or “You’re too small.””Oh, meh, meh, meh.”</p><p class="has-text-align-center has-background" style=background-color:#e490e5><a href=# data-type=post data-id=5695 rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sloane Stephens Weight Gain: A Closer Look at Recent Changes</strong></a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Selena Gomez goes live on TikTok to address comments about her body.

All I want is for everybody to realize how amazing and gorgeous you are. Indeed, we all have bad days, but I would much rather be well and take care of myself. My drugs are essential, and I think that’s what makes me better.</p><p>She continued by emphasizing that she “never will be” and that she is “not a model.” She said, “And I think they’re awesome, mind you,” as her final statement. Simply said, I’m not that. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your support and love for me. If not, please leave; in all honesty, I don’t think it’s right to shame individuals for anything, including their bodies.</p><p class="has-text-align-center has-background" style=background-color:#e490e5><a href=# data-type=post data-id=5840 rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Julia Ormond Weight Gain: A Closer Look at Her Weight Journey</strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebtransformations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-TheNewsPocket-2024-01-30T113249.513-1024x576.png><p>In 2015, Selena disclosed her health for the first time. “I received a lupus diagnosis and underwent chemotherapy.” That was the main purpose of my break. My stroke may have happened,” she told Billboard.</p><p>She revealed to ET Canada later in 2019 that she has high blood pressure, kidney problems, and lupus, which are the main causes of her health concerns. And that’s when I began to notice the body image issues. It combines all of them. I will need to take this drug for the remainder of my life. To be honest, it depends on the month. When people started criticizing me for [my weight], I became aware of it. And that’s simply my reality, to be honest. I change throughout. Depending on what’s going on in my life. And you know, that got to me. That screwed me up for a while, I suppose,” she remarked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summary</h2><p>Selena Gomez candidly discusses the impact of lupus medication on her weight, urging fans not to feel shame. Addressing body image criticism, she emphasizes self-love and the essential nature of her medication. Gomez, who revealed her lupus diagnosis in 2015, encourages others to embrace their uniqueness and dismisses societal standards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8DRmqWsnp%2BnuqLAyKilrGaTpLpwv8SlnKeZXZy8rrHZZq6eoZedwW6zwKKlZmpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shay-johnson-announces-pregnancy-with-kontrol-magazine-cover-reveal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shay Johnson Announces Pregnancy With Kontrol Magazine Cover Reveal">&larr;
