She’s <a href=#>Anna Kendrick </a>and she is the woman everyone wants to be – or at least be best friends with. She’s so down-to-earth and completely normal (I mean, how many famous Hollywood celebrities are actually normal?) and she’s just plain cool. And that’s why people love her. Trust me when I say that when people love her, they LOVE her. They are obsessed with her. Perhaps it’s her insane sense of humor, her easygoing personality or the fact that she absolutely seems just like you might imagine she is in real life when you see her in a movie, an interview or anywhere else. She just seems like the cool girl that’s not mean to anyone, that’s happy to spend Friday night with a pizza and pajamas and that could really, honestly, truly be your best friend and soul sister forever and ever. And if you aren’t sure you totally love Anna Kendrick just yet, let us give you 10 (really amazing) reasons we love her endlessly.</p><h2>She’s Funny</h2><p>Who doesn’t love someone that cracks you up without even trying? Anna Kendrick is hilarious in a way that is not easy for many people. It comes off as completely effortless for her, and that makes us fall a little bit more in love with her on a regular basis. This is where we would hashtag “Stalker” and pretend it’s a joke even though it’s not.</p><h2>She’s a Drinker</h2><p>When her friend sent her a care package filled with a dozen bottles of booze, she shared a photo with the world. And then she said that she might pretend she was offended for getting a care package like that, but she was too darn excited to be offended about a care package like that. Clearly, she and I are best friends and twins from another universe.</p><h2>She’s an Amazing Singer, but She’s not Trying to be a Singer</h2><p>This is probably one of the most amazing things about Anna Kendrick. She is a seriously talented singer. Not just talented in a way that’s cute or okay, but seriously talented. She has one of the prettiest and most amazing voices you’ve ever heard. But what’s even better about her is that she is not trying to be a singer. She’s cool being an actress.</p><h2>She’s Just a Little Lazy</h2><p>Who doesn’t love a woman that is just a bit lazy? Her favorite way to spend most any day or night is at home in clothes you can’t wear in public doing things like eating Taco Bell and watching really ridiculous shows on Netflix. We can’t say we hate that. In fact, we can’t say we aren’t thinking about cancelling our plans tonight and maybe, possibly, potentially doing the same thing. Oh, except tonight’s plans aren’t cancel-able, so, boo to that.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/460224130.jpg alt="anna kendrick " width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Her Favorite Part of Red Carpet Night is Pajamas Afterward</h2><p>She recently told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview that her favorite part of any night on the red carpet is coming home and putting on the onesie pajamas that Ellen gave to her on a previous visit to the show. And that she would like more onesie pajamas like yesterday. I need onesie pajamas (my husband is shaking his head in horror right now).</p><h2>She’s a Family Person</h2><p>Family is important. In fact, it’s the most important. And even though my kids don’t seem to understand what it really means just yet, I plan on spending as much time with them as I can for the rest of their lives. They love that now, but they will soon hate that before they begin to love it again. And they better marry people that love me, or their lives will be miserable, because I’ll still be around. On that note, Anna Kendrick likes to spend time with her family, and that’s awesome.</p><h2>She’s Self-Deprecating</h2><p>We love anyone that can make fun of themselves and still be confident and amazing. We love it when people realize their flaws, but don’t actually care about their flaws. It’s one of the best things about any person, ever. How can you not love that? Sometimes people think that self-deprecating women have no confidence or that they are just fishing for compliments, but you can tell when a woman is just truly okay with her flaws and imperfections, because she can make fun of them without ulterior motives. You can just tell.</p><h2>She’s the Best Twitter User</h2><p>If you are not following Anna Kendrick on Twitter, get to it. You will find that her tweets are the reason you wake up in the morning. All right, so the reason you woke up in the morning is because you woke up because it wasn’t your time to go just yet, but you’ll find yourself stalking her feed to make sure you did not miss anything hilarious. You probably did miss something hilarious, though, because she is completely hilarious.</p><h2>She Cheers Us Up</h2><p>When we’re having a bad day, we can just watch her in a movie or in an interview and immediately feel much better. She’s like the best friend you have but just way cooler, since she is famous and stuff. But there is never a time in which watching her and listening to her is not something that cheers you right up. She just reminds you that things are cool and that stuff happens, and that you should suck it up and move on with your life. She’s a bit more tactful about it, but you get the point.</p><h2>She’s Gorgeous</h2><p>Who does not love a gorgeous woman? And not just because she’s aesthetically gorgeous, either. She’s the kind of person who has a good personality, and that makes her even more gorgeous on the outside. When the inside is gorgeous, the outside is even more gorgeous. We love a woman like that. Why? Because she’s strong, powerful and totally awesome. What’s not to love?</p><p>Photos by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWimq60u82sZJqao6S5tsDEpbBmpJ%2Brsm6tzaeYZqOVo7GztcKkZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-adefeso-addresses-the-reasons-for-which-lots-of-small-businesses-fail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Adefeso Addresses The Reasons For Which Lots Of Small Businesses Fail">&larr;
