The conversation allegedly took place while Parker’s 9-year-old twins were in the house.</p><p>The couple finally agreed to split on Jan. 6, but two days later, when Parker went to move her stuff out of the Sugar Land house, Hanks allegedly “became extremely aggressive.”</p><p>She claims he came at her with a knife — and that she defended herself by swinging a pot at his head.</p><p>Footage <a href=#>published by TMZ last month</a> showed Hanks accusing Parker of threatening him with a knife, not the other way around.</p><p>The video showed Parker lunging at Hanks with a pot, leaving him with a gushing head wound. He also accused her of stealing his money and credit cards.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Kiana Parker’s lawyers allege Chet Hanks exhibited domestic abuse toward his ex-girlfriend.<span class=credit>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Hanks subsequently sued Parker for assault and battery, theft and return of the money she allegedly stole from him.</p><p>He didn’t immediately respond to Parker’s lawsuit on Tuesday, but about an hour after the press conference, announced he would be dropping <a href=#>his “White Boy Summer” music video</a> early.</p><p>“F–k it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a> on Instagram. “I was gonna wait til Friday but I see y’all really ready for this. ‘White Boy Summer’ dropping 6 p.m. today.”</p><p>Parker’s lawyers, Murray and D’Angelo Lowe, said they had reached out to Hanks’ and his famous parents about Parker’s accusations “multiple times” in January and February, but never heard back.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Chet Hanks would have been charged by now,” Lowe added. “Instead, he has not been charged and has made a mockery of black women in the criminal justice system by proclaiming that it’s going to be a ‘white boy summer,’ and a ‘black queen summer’ while knowing he mentally and physically abused a black queen.”</p><p>Hanks’ attorney, Marty Singer, told The Post in statement that, “We consider the claims filed by Kiana Parker to be a shakedown.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Parker and Hanks started dating in March 2019.<span class=credit>Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for BET</span></figure><p>Singer noted that his client was suing Parker over the January incident, claiming that “while Ms. Parker was accompanied by a huge male carrying a gun she viciously attacked Chet which caused him to profusely bleed.”</p><p>“Her claims are completely false, fabricated and fictional,” Singer added.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk52ytXnHmqWkq12axW6zyKujn6qZmrulecqimKeZXaWus7fEq2SsrZWoeqm1zGadqKpdZrpuu9WeqWaZnKGyqLHDZpibraOafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-calen-uhlig-dead-tracing-the-last-moments-of-the-bass-artist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Calen Uhlig Dead?
