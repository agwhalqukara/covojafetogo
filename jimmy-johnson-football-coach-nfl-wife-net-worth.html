In addition, he assisted in the recruitment of football player <a href=#>Terry Bradshaw</a> to the Louisiana <a href=#>football team</a>.</p><p>He attended Iowa State University and then the University of Oklahoma. The <a href=#>sports commentator</a> returned to Arkansas to work as the defensive coordinator’s University of Arkansas.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Coaching Career at Oklahoma State</h3><p>Johnson’s first head schooling job was at Oklahoma State University in 1979. With the Oklahoma Cowboys, he coached for five incredible seasons. Jimmy was offered the head coach position at the University of Miami in 1984.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Coaching Career at the University of Miami</h3><p>Even though he didn’t get a warm welcome or have a smooth start as the coach of the Miami Hurricanes, the former national champions, he finally demonstrated his worth to the collegiate squad.</p><p>Nonetheless, throughout the five years he coached the Hurricanes, he taught them to be so good that they were labeled the ‘Decade of Dominance.’ The Miami Hurricanes went on to triumph in the National Championship in 1987, had a 52-9 record, and were summoned to five New Year’s Day bowl games, earning Johnson admission into the College Football Hall of Fame.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Coaching Career at Dallas Cowboys</h3><p>Johnson’s old University of Arkansas teammate, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, approached him in 1989 and requested him to be the team’s head coach. It was his first position as a professional coach.</p><p>When the Cowboys triumphed in the Superbowl in 1992 and 1993, the former football player became one of just six coaches to lead their club to two consecutive victories. After winning the Super Bowl in 1993, Jimmy received a $2 million bonus from the Cowboys. However, the two appear to have put their differences aside and are now on speaking terms.</p><p>Despite leading the squad to two consecutive victories, he is still not in the team’s Ring Of Honor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Coaching Career at Miami Dolphins</h3><p>Miami worked as a FOX Sports analyst for two years before becoming the Dolphins’ head coach. However, he was incompetent to duplicate his success with the Cowboys.</p><p>As a result, he announced his retirement from the Dolphins in 1999. However, the team’s defensive players pleaded with him to return, and his old assistant coach was appointed as the defensive coordinator.</p><p>Because of the outcry, he decided to give it one final go, but the result fell short of his expectations. The former NFL coach resigned following the Dolphins’ devastating loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars despite several victories.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Coaching</h3><ul><li>Dallas Cowboys (Head Coach)</li><li>Miami Dolphins (Head Coach)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Johnson Television Career:</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sports Analyst at FOX NFL Sunday</h3><p>Following his NFL career, the 77-year-old returned to FOX Sports and became an analyst for FOX NFL Sunday. Along with former football players and a broadcaster, he is a star. In January, he’ll be a studio analyst for Fox’s coverage of the Bowl Championship Series, which Chris Rose will host, and he also writes a column for Foxsports.com.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Commercials</h3><p>Procter & Gamble and a series of ads for the male enhancement drug ExtenZe in 2010 are among Johnson’s endorsements. He was also a part of The Leading Edge, a South Florida-based con that claimed to highlight businesses on an “educational” “interstitial” program that would run on public television.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the TV advertisements were shot in the form of an infomercial, and businesses were pitched on the show using these snippets, which were then posted on the internet. They were paid an “underwriting fee” of more than $20,000 to appear on the show, but it was never shown. In addition, they were not linked with PBS, and no air dates have been recorded.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Survivor</h3><p>The father of two is a great admirer of the reality show Survivor, and he was cast in the show’s 21st season. However, he discovered that watching the show was far more comfortable and enjoyable than participating in it. He stated he was uncomfortable there and was delighted to return home when he got out on Day Eight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Johnson Achievements and Awards:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td><ul class=awards><li>2× Super Bowl champion (XXVII, XXVIII)</li><li>AP NFL Coach of the Year (1990)</li><li>National champion (1987)</li><li>Walter Camp Coach of the Year (1986)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>As a head coach:</strong></p><p>2× Super Bowl champion (XXVII, XXVIII)</p><p>AP NFL Coach of the Year (1990)</p><p>A national champion (1987)</p><p>Walter Camp Coach of the Year (1986)</p><p><strong>As a player:</strong></p><p>A national champion (1964)</p><p>2× SWC champion (1961, 1964)</p><p>All-SWC (1964)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Johnson National Football League Hall of Fame Induction</h2><p>Johnson was surprised by Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker during a telecast of Fox NFL Sunday on January 12, 2020, when he was announced as the 328th member of the Pro Hall of Fame in Canton.
