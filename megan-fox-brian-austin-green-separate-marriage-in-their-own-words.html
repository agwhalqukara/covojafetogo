The couple would share their thoughts about parenting their sons<strong> Noah </strong>and<strong> Bodhi</strong>, enjoying date nights, and looking forward to their future together.</p><p>Here,<strong> Us</strong>&nbsp;compiles their key quotes about their relationship, including one in which Fox said: “I don’t want to be boastful and say that we would never divorce, but I can’t imagine a scenario we couldn’t work through.”</p><p><strong>Forever After</strong></p><p>After the pair called off their three-year engagement in February 2009, Green re-proposed in June 2010. The stars tied the knot 24 days later in Hawaii. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life,” the Beverly Hills, 90210 hunk said of his marriage. “It was the absolute perfect start to what we hope will be an amazing life together.”</p><p><strong>The Struggles of Parenting</strong></p><p>“It’s a lot of work and I didn’t hire any help because I overestimated my own abilities,” Fox told the UK’s Daily Mirror in December 2012 after their son Noah was born. “I had no idea how difficult babies could be, so Brian and I were exhausted. You never sleep and you’re awake all night and your entire life is devoted to this little thing that needs you constantly.”</p><p>In fact, Fox joked about splitting due to sleep deprivation. “Two weeks ago I said to Brian, ‘We have to get a night nurse or we’re going to get a divorce,'” she told the paper. “‘Because somebody’s got to sleep in this house or we’re going to kill each other.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Marriage Takes Work</strong></p><p>“I just think we got lucky,” Fox said of Green in the <a href=#>March 2013 issue of Marie Claire UK</a>. “I believe he’s my soul mate.”</p><p>Fox also opined about how marriage requires acceptance, even though she thought the two were meant to be. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t take work, because we are very, very different,” she continued. “But we are tolerant of each other and we try to be patient with each other, and I don’t try to turn him into me and he knows not to try to turn me into him. He really is amazing. I should never, ever even think about complaining.”</p><p><strong>Happy Wife, Happy Life</strong></p><p>Green <a href=#>spoke to <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in September 2013 about his wife’s second pregnancy (when they were expecting baby Bodhi). “I do whatever she asks for and I say yes no matter what it may be!” he told <strong>Us</strong> at a Generosity Water event. “She’s doing great. She did great the first time around, but I wouldn’t wish the experience on anybody! I couldn’t do it! I couldn’t make a baby, it’s unbelievable!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Sex — and the Lack Thereof</strong></p><p>“I am not the person to ask about keeping a marriage hot!” Fox told Cosmopolitan in its August 2014 issue. “Joe Gorga from The Real Housewives of New Jersey used to say he was ‘full of poison’ and needed to have sex with his wife to get rid of it. That always made me laugh, because if it’s true, I’m surprised Brian hasn’t experienced toxic shock syndrome.”</p><p>She did, however, dish some steamy details about their sex life. “I would say we’re both pretty low-maintenance, but he’s naturally happy being a giver. I’m not going to fight it,” she revealed of their bedroom antics. “Brian has been famous his whole life, so there aren’t any weird places he’s had sex. He’s too self-conscious. As for me, I get afraid when we’re in a hotel room! I’ll close the curtains and put something over the peephole. I’m always afraid someone is going to see.”</p><p><strong>The Realities of Romance With Kids</strong></p><p>“Since Noah was born, we’ve been on three dates,” she told Cosmo in the same issue. “It’s really hard for me to justify taking two hours to take a shower and get ready then to leave for dinner. Now we’re talking four hours, and that’s too long. I’ll do it for work, because I have to. But to do it because I’m choosing to go out, I haven’t worked my way up to that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Working It Out</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You have to be with someone who loves you at your absolute worst, because you can’t be an actress every moment of the day forever. Brian and I have done everything you can do to ruin a relationship and we still love each other,” Fox revealed to Cosmo in its August 2014 issue. “I don’t want to be boastful and say that we would never divorce, but I can’t imagine a scenario we couldn’t work through…”</p><p><strong>Sacrifices and Compromise</strong></p><p>“A big part is that we respect each other as parents. I feel sorry for women who have babies with men only to find out their husbands aren’t helpful, because what you go through as a woman is so incredibly difficult. He’s willing to make sacrifices to keep us all happy,” she shared to Cosmo in August 2014. “When he sees I’m getting overwhelmed, he’ll say, ‘I have both of them. Go take a nap.’ That will keep me married to him forever. But I don’t know anything about keeping the sex life going!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSen5Gjeqe712aZq6GRo3qiwdKtoKdll6eyprqMrJypmaKWwaZ5zJqpq6GRnLJutc1mq6Gdmad6sMPNZq6oqpSoenN8kG5ocnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rogen-katherine-heigl-is-hypocritical-for-calling-knocked-up-sexist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rogen: Katherine Heigl Is Hypocritical for Calling Knocked Up Sexist">&larr;
