This is the case with Jennifer Lucas who despite being a TV and film producer is best known for her marriage to Byron Allen. Allen, like his wife, has an active career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He is the head of his own production company, Entertainment Studios, also known as Allen Media Group.

For her big day, Lucas wore a white tube wedding gown by Carolina Herrera. Planned by Mindy Weiss, the wedding reception hall looked like something from a fantasy movie decorated with thousands of red roses.</p><p>For dessert, guests at the wedding were served with a five-tiered cake with two flavors – vanilla cake with dark chocolate filling and dark chocolate cake with chocolate mousse filling.
