Although the role of Nontle did not match her age profile in reality, she was able to bring the character to life without giving away the disparity. The stylish and beautiful actress looks up to other South African TV legends such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Vusi Kunene</a> and Samela Tyelbooi as her role models in acting and judging from the energy she brings to the set, you can easily tell that one day she will become a legendary actress.</p><p>Buntu Petse is also one of the South African female celebrities who is absolutely confident in showing off her face without makeup, wig or beautiful braids on social media. Though she has not been in the industry for so long, there are so many things to know about her.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Buntu Petse’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Buntu Petse</li><li><b>Nickname: </b>Nontle</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Female</li><li><b>Date of birth: </b>February 12, 1997</li><li><b>Place of birth: </b>Johannesburg, South Africa</li><li><b>Buntu Petse’s Age: </b>26 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>African</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>South African</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b>Aquarius</li><li><strong>Alma mater</strong>: University of Witwatersrand</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Actress</li><li><b>Buntu Petse’s Height in Inches: </b>5’5</li><li><b>Buntu Petse’s Height in Centimetres: </b>168</li><li><strong>Shoe Size:</strong> 5/6</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Playing the role of Nontle Majola in Generations: The Legacy</li><li><b><strong>Buntu Petse</strong>’s Instagram: </b><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">buntu_p</a></li><li><b>Twitter: </b><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@petse_buntu</a></li><li><b>TikTok: </b><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">buntu_petse</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Buntu Petse Was Born In 1997 and is Currently</strong><strong>&nbsp;26 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Judging from how beautiful, stunning, and mature Buntu Petse looks, it may come as a surprise to learn that she was born on the 12th of February 1997 which makes her 26 years old. She can easily pass for a much older lady because of the elegance she displays and the way she carries herself.</p><p>Buntu Petse is an educated young woman and you can tell that from her command of the English language, but we don’t have information with regards to where she obtained her basic education. What we know is that she attended the University of the Witwatersrand from where she graduated with a degree in Dramatic Arts.</p><h2><strong>She Joined The Entertainment Industry As A Teenage Presenter</strong></h2><p>You may know Buntu Petse as an actress, but her first-ever television appearance was not in a movie, but rather as a television presenter. As a teenager, she was featured on SABC1’s science and technology show called Teenagers on a Mission as a teenage presenter. Though this show was her first public appearance, it does not take the credit for making her famous.</p><h3><strong>Buntu Petse’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Parents Are Very Supportive</strong></h3><p>Whenever we see children or teenagers who start their career at young ages, the story that usually follows is either that they have supportive parents or parents who are already making it in the industry. In Buntu Petse’s case, her parents are not known to be in the entertainment industry, but they were very supportive of her interest in being in the industry. We do not know whether or not she has siblings.</p><h2><strong>Buntu Petse Landed Her Breakthrough In Her Final Year In The University</strong></h2><p>While Buntu Petse was in her final year as a student at the University of Witwatersrand, she enrolled to audition for a role in the popular South African soapie Generations: The Legacy. Fortunately for her, she was selected to join the soap opera. Though she landed the role while she was still a student, she still completed her degree.</p><h2><strong>She Has Endeared Herself To Many Viewers Of Generations: The Legacy</strong></h2><p>In the TV series, Buntu Petse played the role of a bold and outspoken 16-year-old daughter of Ayanda who never knew her father. Coupled with the rage she felt after meeting her mother and her passion for the fight against climate change, she was very bold in high school.</p><p>In the soapie, she was so bold and outspoken that she started receiving death threats. Buntu played her role so well that in a few months of joining the series, she was already becoming the viewers’ favorite. Since she came into the limelight, Buntu Petse has grown in popularity that she now has over 200,000 Instagram followers and fans are absolutely loving her.</p><h2><strong>Buntu Petse Was Named The Face of #OpenUpTheIndustry</strong></h2><p>The fame that came with being a part of the cast of the TV show, Generations: The Legacy opened up other opportunities for her, as she was fast becoming the name on the lips of many South African soap opera lovers.</p><p>In 2020, despite being new to the movie and entertainment industry, she was selected as the face of #OpenUpTheIndustry, a project that was geared at creating more employment opportunities for actors in South Africa. She was very excited about being the face of the movement and referred to it as being ‘influential’.</p><h2><strong>Though Not Married, Buntu Petse Expects To Start Her Own Family In A Couple Of Years</strong></h2><p>In an interview with IOL in 2020, Buntu Petse was asked where she sees herself in the next five years and she said she sees herself living in a beautiful home, married with a child, and most importantly, doing what she loves doing most, which is acting.</p><p>It’s been over a year since the interview and she is not married nor does she have a child, but she is very much doing what she loves the most. Hopefully, before the end of the next four years, she would have walked down the aisle with the love of her life and have her own home, after all, dreams come true.</p><h3><strong>Buntu Petse Keeps Her Love Life Private</strong></h3><p>Considering Buntu’s 5-year vision for herself, you would expect that she is in a serious relationship with someone who she hopes to marry in the next few years. But we do not know who this Prince Charming is.</p><p>Though a lot of fans would like to know who exactly she is in a relationship with, she prefers to keep her private life away from the public domain, as a result of this, we can’t even say for sure if she is dating anyone now.</p><h2><strong>Her Dream TV Role Is Playing Detective</strong></h2><p>In the same 2020 interview with IOL, Buntu Petse mentioned that she does not have a preference for the kind of role she is given to act because she is someone who likes taking any challenge that is thrown at her.</p><p>However, she also mentioned that her dream role is to act as a Chief Detective who would be in charge of catching the bad guys. She also found it noteworthy to mention that she wanted to act as a detective in her own TV series, which means that we should be expecting her project in the future.</p><h3><strong>She Believes That Social Media Is One Of The Challenges Youths Are Facing</strong></h3><p>Buntu Petse is very much active on social media where she regularly uploads pictures of herself serving body goals, but she is still of the notion that social media can have negative impacts on the mental health of youths in the country. She believes that it increases the peer pressure that youths are facing and it robs people of the opportunity for face-to-face interactions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaJ6RmMG0ecCbpq6sXZfCr8DUZqeerKOaerOxwKVkpaGWmnqiusNmp6iqpKeuuq3LZqafZZ6ku7W4xGadq6edYrSmusSrmK2hn6PAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-sharon-sevn-strickland-from-baking-it-season-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Sharon Sevn Strickland From Baking It Season 2">&larr;
